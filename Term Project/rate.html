No, we wanted to create a public page that's beautiful but even though I tried to follow many tutorials to deploys / publicize the project, it was difficult.<br><br></td>

The installation and configuration of Django was more difficult because there are more prerequisites steps to go through before we can successfully installed the Django itself. <br><br></td>

Django is designed to be front-end compatible, so it will do nothing to get in the way of you adding whatever you like to the front-end, so it wasn't very difficult to create the html page. However, it was not very easy to use as a newbie. <br><br></td>

                                                <td><br>Materialize's learning curve is almost the same as HTML/CSS because both frameworks are very similar to one another. The main differences we found between them were only their components and the grid system. The learning curve is a bit steeper than the other frameworks because there isn't many straight forward tutorials to help in aid with the development / deployment of Django projects. It is a great tool in building databases for blogs and more complicated websites that require a DB. You can do so with one click.<br><br></td>

                                                <td><br> No we do not have any regrets because we were able to make a very attactive and functional page which was not complicated at all to create. We did not regret choosing Django despite the difficulty in finding proper tutorials. It wasn't that difficult of a framework to work with. We just needed more time to get familiar with the framework. I think it is a very powerful framework.<br><br></td>
